# [Phenotypic Data Analysis Workflow and Documentation](https://whussain2.github.io/Analysis-pipeline/Codes/sample.html)

- This repository contains the end-to-end analysis workflow of phenotypic data. The workflow is divided into two parts: 1) Pre-processing and Quality Check
 and 2) Data Analysis analysis in ASReml R package and lme4 R package.

# Overview of Workflow and Pipeline


```
- In this pipeline we demosntrated the state-of-the-art implementation of the phenotypic data analysis pipeline and workflow embedded into a well-descriptive document. 
- The developed analytical pipeline is open-source, demonstrating how to analyze the phenotypic data in crop breeding programs with step-by-step instructions.

- The analysis pipeline shows how to pre-process and check the quality of phenotypic data, perform robust data analysis using modern statistical tools and approaches, and convert it into a reproducible document. 

- Explanatory text with R codes, outputs either in text, tables, or graphics, and interpretation of results are integrated into the unified document. The analysis is highly reproducible and can be regenerated at any time.

```

- The schematic representation of analysis workflow is given in figure:

#  Source code and Document

***
## 1. Pre-Processing and Quality Check
***

- The source in ****.Rmd****  is available here [Sample Pre Processing](https://github.com/whussain2/Analysis-pipeline/blob/master/Codes/Quality_check.Rmd)

- The HTML file is available here [Pre-processing and Quality Check HMTL](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/whussain2/Analysis-pipeline/blob/master/Codes/Quality_check.html)

***
## 2. Data Analysis
***

- Data analysis is shown both in **ASReml R** package and in **lme4 R** package. The reason to show analysis in lme4 R package is because it is free and open source R package and can be used by all users.  For ASReml R users need license. 

***
### a) Analysis in ASReml R
***

- The source in ****.Rmd****  is available here [Asreml R Workflow](https://github.com/whussain2/Analysis-pipeline/blob/master/Codes/ASReml.Rmd)

- The HTML file is available here [ASReml R Workflow HMTL](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/whussain2/Analysis-pipeline/blob/master/Codes/ASReml.html)

***
### b) Analysis in lme4 R
***

- The source in ****.Rmd****  is available here [lme4 R Workflow](https://github.com/whussain2/Analysis-pipeline/blob/master/Codes/lme4.Rmd)
-
- The HTML file is available here [lme4 R Workflow HTML ](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/whussain2/Analysis-pipeline/blob/master/Codes/lme4.html)


# How to Use the Source Codes and Run the Pipeline


The steps to use the source codes and run it on local computer is given below:

- Open the GitHub page containing the source codes and files by using clicking the link [https://github.com/whussain2/Analysis-pipeline.git](https://github.com/whussain2/Analysis-pipeline.git).
- This will pop-up the Github repository, click on the **Code** button on right side of page highlighted as green box and scroll and click on **Download Zip**.
- Save and unzip the downloaded repository in local drive.  
- Open the ***.Rmd*** file in R Studio and make sure to change the working directory based on users defined path to the repository.

- Also users must install and upload the following R packages before running the pipeline:

```
library(easypackages)
  libraries("dplyr", "reshape2", "readxl", "ggpubr","stringr", "ggplot2", 
  "tidyverse","lme4", "data.table", "readr","plotly", "DT",
  "pheatmap","asreml", "VennDiagram", "patchwork", "heatmaply", 
  "ggcorrplot", "RColorBrewer", "hrbrthemes", "tm", "proustr", "arm",
   "gghighlight", "desplot", "gridExtra", "TeachingDemos", "scales", "ASExtras4",
  "FactoMineR", "corrplot", "factoextra", "asremlPLUS")
```

Note: The pipeline requires asreml R package to do the analysis.  If you dont have license for ASReml R then use lme4 R workflow to perform analysis.
